mongodb (1:2.6.11-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  When upgrading MongoDB to 2.6, keep in mind that only upgrades from 2.4 are
  supported. If you wish to upgrade from previous MongoDB versions, you have
  to upgrade to 2.4 first.

  Furthermore, MongoDB 2.6 now enforces document constraints in a more strict
  manner, specifically:

    * Index key length limit: 2.6 implements a stronger enforcement of the
      limit on index key. Index creation, document inserts and updates may
      fail if an index entry exceeds the limit.

    * Field name restrictions: Updates no longer support saving field names
      containing a dot ('.'), or beginning with a dollar sign ('$'). Note that
      these restrictions on field names have been introduced in MongoDB 2.2.

  To check your existing database for compatibility with MongoDB 2.6, run

    $ db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()

  on a MongoDB 2.6 client connected to your existing MongoDB 2.4 database.

  Additionally, MongoDB 2.6 introduces a new authorization model, which
  requires manual action to migrate to.

  For a full list of changes as well as instructions on how to upgrade
  standalone servers and replica sets, see:
