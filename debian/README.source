git-buildpackage
================

Use of the command `git-import-orig` from the git-buildpackage suite of
scripts is highly encouraged, as it makes for an easier maintenance of the
packaging.

When importing new upstream versions, it is recommended to run:

    git-buildpackage --pristine-tar --uscan

so that most of the tasks are automated.


debian/gbp.conf
===============

The `debian/*` files from the upstream tarball are filtered out (read:
"mostly ignored") because of divergences that create conflicts that are
difficult to merge.

That being said, it is a good thing to manually check what upstream changed
in their `debian` dir and adapt those changes to the Debian packaging, as
they may have changed build dependencies or other assumptions.
