MongoDB for Debian
------------------

Database at different location from upstream

  To be consistent with the Debian Policy, the mongodb-server package puts
  the databases under the /var/lib/mongodb directory instead of what
  upstream uses in its documentation (namely, /data/db).

  You can change this on your installation by editing the configuration file
  /etc/mongodb.conf in the dbpath directive.

Binds only to localhost
  
  As mongo needs some tuning to become secure, it binds to localhost by
  default. You can change this behavior in /etc/mongodb.conf by
  editing/removing/commenting out bind_ip line.

Why only for x86 and amd64?

  The mongodb server depends on both little-endianness and unaligned memory
  access, which I believe means it can only work on i386 and amd64. We believe
  that the mongodb will be useful even it is not available for all Debian
  supported platforms.
