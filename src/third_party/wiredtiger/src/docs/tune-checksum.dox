/*! @page tune_checksum Checksums

WiredTiger optionally checksums file reads and writes to detect storage
failures.  In read-only applications, or when file compression provides
any necessary checksum functionality, or when using backing storage
systems where blocks require no validation, performance can be increased
by turning off checksum support when calling the WT_SESSION::create
method.

Checksums can be configured to be "off" or "on", as well as "uncompressed".
The "uncompressed" configuration checksums blocks not otherwise protected
by compression.   For example, in a system where the compression algorithms
provide sufficient protection against corruption, and when writing a block
which is too small to be usefully compressed, setting the checksum
configuration value to "uncompressed" causes WiredTiger to checksum the
blocks which are not compressed:

@snippet ex_all.c Configure checksums to uncompressed

The default WiredTiger configuration is \c uncompressed.
