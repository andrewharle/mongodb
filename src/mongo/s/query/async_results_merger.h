/**
 * Given a set of cursorIds across one or more shards, the AsyncResultsMerger calls getMore on the
 * cursors to present a single sorted or unsorted stream of documents.
 *
 * (A cursor-generating command (e.g. the find command) is one that establishes a ClientCursor and a
 * matching cursorId on the remote host. In order to retrieve all document results, getMores must be
 * issued against each of the remote cursors until they are exhausted).
 *
 * The ARM offers a non-blocking interface: if no results are immediately available on this host for
 * retrieval, calling nextEvent() schedules work on the remote hosts in order to generate further
 * results. The event is signaled when further results are available.
 *
 * Work on remote nodes is accomplished by scheduling remote work in TaskExecutor's event loop.
 *
 * Task-scheduling behavior differs depending on whether there is a sort. If the result documents
 * must be sorted, we pass the sort through to the remote nodes and then merge the sorted streams.
 * This requires waiting until we have a response from every remote before returning results.
 * Without a sort, we are ready to return results as soon as we have *any* response from a remote.
 *
 * On any error, the caller is responsible for shutting down the ARM using the kill() method.
 *
 * Does not throw exceptions.
