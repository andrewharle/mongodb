/**
 * ClusterCursorManager is a container for ClusterClientCursor objects.  It manages the lifetime of
 * its registered cursors and tracks basic information about them.
 *
 * Each registered cursor is either in a 'pinned' or an 'idle' state.  Registered cursors must be
 * pinned in order to iterate results, and cursors may only be pinned by one client at a time (this
 * ensures that the result stream is only directed to a single client at a time).  Pinning a cursor
 * transfers ownership of the cursor to a PinnedCursor object (although the manager maintains
 * information about registered cursors even when they're pinned).  Ownership is transferred back to
 * the manager by calling PinnedCursor::returnCursor().
 *
 * The manager supports killing of registered cursors, either through the PinnedCursor object or
 * with the kill*() suite of methods.  These simply mark the affected cursors as 'kill pending',
 * which can be cleaned up by later calls to the reapZombieCursors() method.
 *
 * No public methods throw exceptions, and all public methods are thread-safe.
 *
 * TODO: Add maxTimeMS support.  SERVER-19410.
 * TODO: Add method "size_t killCursorsOnNamespace(const NamespaceString& nss)" for
 *       dropCollection()?
