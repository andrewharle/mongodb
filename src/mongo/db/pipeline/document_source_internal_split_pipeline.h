/**
 * An internal stage available for testing. Acts as a simple passthrough of intermediate results
 * from the source stage, but forces the pipeline to split at the point where this stage appears
 * (assuming that no earlier splitpoints exist). Takes a single parameter, 'mergeType', which can be
 * one of 'primaryShard', 'anyShard' or 'mongos' to control where the merge may occur. Omitting this
 * parameter or specifying 'mongos' produces the default merging behaviour; the merge half of the
 * pipeline will be executed on mongoS if all other stages are eligible, and will be sent to a
 * random participating shard otherwise.
