/**
 * A container which owns ClientCursor objects. This class is used to create, access, and delete
 * ClientCursors. It is also responsible for allocating the cursor ids that are passed back to
 * clients.
 *
 * In addition to managing the lifetime of ClientCursors, the CursorManager is responsible for
 * notifying yielded queries of write operations and collection drops. For this reason, query
 * PlanExecutor objects which are not contained within a ClientCursor are also registered with the
 * CursorManager. Query executors must be registered with the CursorManager, either as a bare
 * PlanExecutor or inside a ClientCursor (but cannot be registered in both ways).
 *
 * There is a CursorManager per-collection and a global CursorManager. The global CursorManager owns
 * cursors whose lifetime is not tied to that of the collection and which do not need to receive
 * notifications about writes for a particular collection. In contrast, cursors owned by a
 * collection's CursorManager, unless pinned, are destroyed when the collection is destroyed. Such
 * cursors receive notifications about writes to the collection.
 *
 * Callers must hold the collection lock in at least MODE_IS in order to access a collection's
 * CursorManager, which guards against the CursorManager being concurrently deleted due to a
 * catalog-level operation such as a collection drop. No locks are required to access the global
 * cursor manager.
 *
 * The CursorManager is internally synchronized; operations on a given collection may call methods
 * concurrently on that collection's CursorManager.
 *
 * See clientcursor.h for more information.
