 * Once scheduled, the reporter will periodically send the current replication progress, obtained
 * by invoking "_prepareReplSetUpdatePositionCommandFn", to its sync source until it encounters
 * an error.
 *
 * If the sync source cannot accept the current format (used by server versions 3.2.4 and above) of
 * the "replSetUpdatePosition" command, the reporter will not abort and instead downgrade the format
 * of the command it will send upstream.
 *
 * While the reporter is active, it will be in one of three states:
 * 1) triggered and waiting to send command to sync source as soon as possible.
 * 2) waiting for command response from sync source.
 * 3) waiting for at least "_keepAliveInterval" ms before sending command to sync source.
 *
 * Calling trigger() while the reporter is in state 1 or 2 will cause the reporter to immediately
 * send a new command upon receiving a successful command response.
 *
 * Calling trigger() while it is in state 3 sends a command upstream and cancels the current
 * keep alive timeout, resetting the keep alive schedule.
