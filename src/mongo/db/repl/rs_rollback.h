/**
 * This rollback algorithm is used when the storage engine does not support recovering to a stable
 * timestamp, or if the forceRollbackViaRefetch parameter is set to true.
 *
 * Rollback via Refetch Overview:
 *
 * Rollback occurs when a node's oplog diverges from its sync source's oplog and needs to regain
 * consistency with the sync source's oplog.
 *
 * R and S are defined below to represent two nodes involved in rollback.
 *
 *     R = The node whose oplog has diverged from its sync source and is rolling back.
 *     S = The sync source of node R.
 *
 * The rollback algorithm is designed to keep S's data and to make node R consistent with node S.
 * One could argue here that keeping R's data has some merits, however, in most
 * cases S will have significantly more data.  Also note that S may have a proper subset of R's
 * stream if there were no subsequent writes. Our goal is to get R back in sync with S.
 *
 * A visualization of what happens in the oplogs of the sync source and node that is rolling back
 * is shown below. On the left side of each example are the oplog entries of the nodes before
 * rollback occurs and on the right are the oplog entries of the node after rollback occurs.
 * During rollback only the oplog entries of R change.
 *
 * #1: Status of R after operations e, f, and g are rolled back to the common point [d].
 * Since there were no other writes to node S after [d], we do not need to apply
 * more writes to node R after rolling back.
 *
 *     R : a b c d e f g                -> a b c d
 *     S : a b c d
 *
 * #2: In this case, we first roll back to [d], and since S has written q to z oplog entries,
 * we need to replay these oplog operations onto R after it has rolled back to the common
 * point.
 *
 *     R : a b c d e f g                -> a b c d q r s t u v w x z
 *     S : a b c d q r s t u v w x z
 *
 * Rollback via Refetch Algorithm:
 *
 * We will continue to use the notation of R as the node whose oplog is inconsistent with
 * its sync source and S as the sync source of R. We will also represent the common point
 * as point C.
 *
 * 1.   Increment rollback ID of node R.
 * 2.   Find the most recent common oplog entry, which we will say is point C. In the above
 *      example, the common point was oplog entry 'd'.
 * 3.   Undo all the oplog entries that occurred after point C on the node R.
 *      a.    Consider how to revert the oplog entries (i.e. for a create collection, drops the
 *            collection) and place that information into a FixUpInfo struct.
 *      b.    Cancel out unnecessary operations (i.e. If dropping a collection, there is no need
 *            to do dropIndex if the index is within the collection that will eventually be
 *            dropped).
 *      c.    Undo all operations done on node R until the point. We attempt to revert all data
 *            and metadata until point C. However, if we need to refetch data from the sync
 *            source, the data on node R will not be completely consistent with what it was
 *            previously at point C, as some of the data may have been modified by the sync
 *            source after the common point.
 *            i.    Refetch any documents from node S that are needed for the
 *                  rollback.
 *           ii.    Find minValid, which is the last OpTime of node S.
 *                  i.e. the last oplog entry of node S at the time that rollback occurs.
 *          iii.    Resync collection data and metadata.
 *           iv.    Update minValid if necessary, as more fetching may have occurred from
 *                  the sync source requiring that minValid is updated to an even later
 *                  point.
 *            v.    Drop all collections that were created after point C.
 *           vi.    Drop all indexes that were created after point C.
 *          vii.    Delete, update and insert necessary documents that were modified after
 *                  point C.
 *         viii.    Truncate the oplog to point C.
 * 4.   After rolling back to point C, node R transitions from ROLLBACK to RECOVERING mode.
 *
 * Steps 5 and 6 occur in ordinary replication code and are not done in this file.
 *
 * 5.   Retrieve the oplog entries from node S until reaching the minValid oplog entry.
 *      a.    Fetch the oplog entries from node S.
 *      b.    Apply the oplog entries of node S to node R starting from point C up until
 *            the minValid
 * 6.   Transition node R from RECOVERING to SECONDARY state.
