 *
 * The intended workflow is as follows:
 *  - Acquire a distributed lock on the database whose primary is about to be moved.
 *  - Instantiate a MovePrimarySourceManager on the stack.
 *  - Call clone to start and finish cloning of the unsharded collections.
 *  - Call enterCriticalSection to cause the shard to enter in 'read only' mode while the config
 *      server is notified of the new primary.
 *  - Call commitOnConfig to indicate the new primary in the config server metadata.
 *  - Call cleanStaleData to drop now-unused collections (and potentially databases) on the
 *      old primary.
 *
 * At any point in time it is safe to let the MovePrimarySourceManager object go out of scope in
 * which case the destructor will take care of clean up based on how far we have advanced.
