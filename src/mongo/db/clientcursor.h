 * A ClientCursor is the server-side state associated with a particular cursor id. A cursor id is a

 * server for certain supported operations.
 *
 * For instance, a client can retrieve the next batch of results from the cursor by issuing a
 * getMore on this cursor id. It can also request that server-side resources be freed by issuing a
 * killCursors on a particular cursor id. This is useful if the client wishes to abandon the cursor
 * without retrieving all results.
 *
 * ClientCursors cannot exist in isolation and must be created, accessed, and destroyed via a
 * CursorManager. See cursor_manager.h for more details. Unless the ClientCursor is marked by the
 * caller as "no timeout", it will be automatically destroyed by its cursor manager after a period
 * of inactivity.

/**
 * ClientCursorPin is an RAII class which must be used in order to access a cursor. On
 * construction, the ClientCursorPin marks its cursor as in use, which is called "pinning" the
 * cursor. On destruction, the ClientCursorPin marks its cursor as no longer in use, which is
 * called "unpinning" the cursor. Pinning is used to prevent multiple concurrent uses of the same
 * cursor--- pinned cursors cannot be deleted or timed out and cannot be used concurrently by other
 * operations such as getMore. They can however, be marked as interrupted and instructed to destroy
 * themselves through killCursors.
 *
 * A pin is obtained using the CursorManager. See cursor_manager.h for more details.
 *
 * A pin extends the lifetime of a ClientCursor object until the pin's release. Pinned ClientCursor
 * objects cannot not be killed due to inactivity, and cannot be immediately erased by user kill
 * requests (though they can be marked as interrupted). When a CursorManager is destroyed (e.g. by
 * a collection drop), ownership of any still-pinned ClientCursor objects is transferred to their
 * managing ClientCursorPin objects.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * {
 *     StatusWith<ClientCursorPin> pin = cursorManager->pinCursor(opCtx, cursorid);
 *     if (!pin.isOK()) {
 *         // No cursor with id 'cursorid' exists, or it was killed while inactive. Handle the error
 *         here.
 *         return pin.getStatus();
 *     }
 *
 *     ClientCursor* cursor = pin.getValue().getCursor();
 *     // Use cursor. Pin automatically released on block exit.
 * }
 *
 * Clients that wish to access ClientCursor objects owned by collection cursor managers must hold
 * the collection lock while calling any pin method, including pin acquisition by the RAII
 * constructor and pin release by the RAII destructor.  This guards from a collection drop (which
 * requires an exclusive lock on the collection) occurring concurrently with the pin request or
 * unpin request.
 *
 * Clients that wish to access ClientCursor objects owned by the global cursor manager need not
 * hold any locks; the global cursor manager can only be destroyed by a process exit.
