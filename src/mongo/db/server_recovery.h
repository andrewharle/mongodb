 * performing replication recovery, we avoid doing so, as we trust that the size metadata on disk is
 * already correct with respect to the end state of recovery.
 *
 * However, there may be exceptions that require the server to adjust size metadata even during
 * recovery. One such case is the oplog: during rollback, the oplog is truncated, and then recovery
 * occurs using oplog entries after the common point from the sync source. The server will need to
 * adjust the size metadata for the oplog collection to ensure that the count of oplog entries is
 * correct after rollback recovery.
 *
 * This class is responsible for keeping track of idents that require this special
 * count adjustment.
