 * mandatory.
 *
 * We use the wire version to determine if two agents (a driver, a mongos, or a mongod) can
 * interact. Each agent carries two versions, a 'max' and a 'min' one. If the two agents
 * are on the same 'max' number, they stricly speak the same wire protocol and it is safe
 * to allow them to communicate. If two agents' ranges do not intersect, they should not be
 * allowed to communicate.
 *
 * If two agents have at least one version in common they can communicate, but one of the
 * sides has to be ready to compensate for not being on its partner version.
