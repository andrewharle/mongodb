 * Retrieves Records from a RecordStore.
 *
 * A cursor is constructed with a direction flag with the following effects:
 *      - The direction that next() moves.
 *      - If a restore cannot return to the saved position, cursors will be positioned on the
 *        closest position *after* the query in the direction of the scan.
 *
 * A cursor is tied to a transaction, such as the OperationContext or a WriteUnitOfWork
 * inside that context. Any cursor acquired inside a transaction is invalid outside
 * of that transaction, instead use the save and restore methods to reestablish the cursor.
 *
 * Any method other than invalidate and the save methods may throw WriteConflictException. If
 * that happens, the cursor may not be used again until it has been saved and successfully
 * restored. If next() or restore() throw a WCE the cursor's position will be the same as before
 * the call (strong exception guarantee). All other methods leave the cursor in a valid state
 * but with an unspecified position (basic exception guarantee). If any exception other than
 * WCE is thrown, the cursor must be destroyed, which is guaranteed not to leak any resources.
 *
 * Any returned unowned BSON is only valid until the next call to any method on this
 * interface.
 *
 * Implementations may override any default implementation if they can provide a more
 * efficient implementation.
 *
 * Storage engines only need to implement the derived SeekableRecordCursor, but may choose
 * to implement this simpler interface for cursors used for repair or random traversal.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE FOR DOCUMENT-LOCKING ENGINES: If you implement capped collections with a
 * "visibility" system such that documents that exist in your snapshot but were inserted after
 * the last uncommitted document are hidden, you must follow the following rules:
 *   - next() must never return invisible documents.
 *   - If next() on a forward cursor hits an invisible document, it should behave as if it hit
 *     the end of the collection.
 *   - When next() on a reverse cursor seeks to the end of the collection it must return the
 *     newest visible document. This should only return boost::none if there are no visible
 *     documents in the collection.
 *   - SeekableRecordCursor::seekExact() must ignore the visibility filter and return the requested
 *     document even if it is supposed to be invisible.
 * TODO SERVER-18934 Handle this above the storage engine layer so storage engines don't have to
 * deal with capped visibility.
