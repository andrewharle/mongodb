This directory contains a number of C++ headers which describe concepts for
C++ types used by and with the Mongo library.  These headers do not describe
instantiable types, but instead are used to concisely describe models of C++
type concepts.  When C++ grows a proper `Concepts` feature, these files can be
converted to proper concepts.
