MongoDB README

DOCUMENTATION

  http://www.mongodb.org/

COMPONENTS

  mongod - The database process.
  mongos - Sharding controller.
  mongo  - The database shell (uses interactive javascript).

BUILDING
      
  see docs/building.md


RUNNING

  ./mongod

  runs the database.  Use 

  ./mongod --help

  to see command line options.

NOTES

  Mongo uses memory mapped files.  If built as a 32 bit executable, you will
  not be able to work with large (multi-gigabyte) databases.  However, 32 bit
  builds work fine with small development databases.
