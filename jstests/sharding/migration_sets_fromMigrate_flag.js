// Tests whether the fromMigrate flag is correctly set during migrations.
//
// Tests:
//      #1 (delete op) fromMigrate is set when recipient shard deletes all documents locally
//         in the chunk range it is about to receive from the donor shard.
//      #2 (delete op) fromMigrate is set when the donor shard deletes documents that have
//         been migrated to another shard.
//      #3 (insert op) fromMigrate is set when the recipient shard receives chunk migration
//         data and inserts it.
//      #4 (update op) fromMigrate is set when an update occurs in the donor shard during
//         migration and is sent to the recipient via the transfer logs.
//      #5 fromMigrate is NOT set on donor shard and IS set on the recipient shard when real
//         delete op is done during chunk migration within the chunk range.
