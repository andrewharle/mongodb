/**
 * DEPRECATED (SERVER-35002): RollbackTest is deprecated. Please use RollbackTestDeluxe instead.
 *
 * Wrapper around ReplSetTest for testing rollback behavior. It allows the caller to easily
 * transition between stages of a rollback without having to manually operate on the replset.
 *
 * This library exposes the following 5 sequential stages of rollback:
 * 1. RollbackTest starts in kSteadyStateOps: the replica set is in steady state replication.
 *        Operations applied will be replicated.
 * 2. kRollbackOps: operations applied during this phase will not be replicated and eventually be
 *        rolled back.
 * 3. kSyncSourceOpsBeforeRollback: apply operations on the sync source before rollback begins.
 * 4. kSyncSourceOpsDuringRollback: apply operations on the sync source after rollback has begun.
 * 5. kSteadyStateOps: (same as stage 1) with the option of waiting for the rollback to finish.
 *
 * Please refer to the various `transition*` functions for more information on the behavior
 * of each stage.
