Instructions for compiling MongoDB in Visual Studio 2008
========================================================

Visual Studio Solution:
-----------------------

mongo.sln -> MongoDB solution that contains all projects necessary for building applications and libraries.



Static Library Projects:
------------------------

mongo_common -> common MongoDB files
core_server -> score server files
server_only -> files for building server-only applications 
shard_server -> shard server files


Console Application Projects:
-----------------------------

mongod -> MongoDB server (links mongo_common and server_only)
mongo -> MongoDB shell (links mongo_common)
mongobridge -> MongoDB bridge server shell (links mongo_common and server_only)
mongodump -> MongoDB dump application (links mongo_common and server_only)
mongoexport -> MongoDB export application (links mongo_common and server_only)
mongofiles -> MongoDB files application (links mongo_common and server_only)
mongoimportjson -> MongoDB import json application (links mongo_common and server_only)
mongorestore -> MongoDB restore application (links mongo_common and server_only)
mongos -> MongoDB shard server (links mongo_common, core_server and shard_server)


Client Driver Library:
-----------------------------

mongoclient -> static library containing client driver files



Notes:
======

1) All static libraries derive project settings from Project Property Sheet "mongo_lib" 
(View->Other Windows->Property Manager).  Settings configured in this Property Sheet will
be inherited by all static library projects (Include Directories, Library Directories, etc).

2) All console applications derive project settings from "mongo_app".

3) msvc_scripting.cpp is used to control the javascript library to use - to change, simply
modify the "Preprocessor" project setting in the Property Sheets to reflect the required
javascript option (USESM or NOJNI).
